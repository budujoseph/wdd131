                <p>Hello! My name is Joseph Budu Larbi and i am from Accra,Ghana. I enjoy playing basketball 
                   and surfing the internet. I look forward in getting a good grade for WDD 131 and be a
                   web developer. Beginning of the course was not easy for me but i am really trying and i see
                   progress each and every day. As an upcoming web developer i should stay consistent and 
                   make sure and practice and get the concept being thought.I know that nothing good comes
                   easy so i have to put in work and also rely on God and His son Jesus Christ for help.
                   Saying a prayer any time i am about to study has really helped me a lot as the Holy Ghost
                   helps me to remember the things i have learnt.

                    Ghana covers an area of 239,567 km2 (92,497 sq mi), spanning diverse ecologies, from coastal savannas to tropical
                    rainforests. With nearly 35 million inhabitants, Ghana is the second-most populous country in West Africa.
                    The capital and largest city is Accra; other significant cities include Kumasi, Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi.
                    In 1957 Ghana became the first colony in Sub-Saharan Africa to achieve sovereignty, 
                    under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah.<!--The nation is renowned for its diverse ethnic groups,
                    including the Akan, Mole-Dagbani, and Ewe, each contributing to a colorful tapestry of traditions, languages,
                    and festivals. Ghana's economy is primarily based on agriculture, with cocoa, gold, and oil being key exports.
                    The country is also celebrated for its warm hospitality and a strong sense of community, making it a welcoming
                    destination for traveler. -->
